    <h1>My Hobby: Music & Creating Beats</h1>

    <p>One of my biggest hobbies is creating music and experimenting with 
       different sounds in FL Studio. I enjoy doing this a lot</p>

    <h2>Why do I enjoy making music in my free time?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It allows me to express myself and use my creativity</li>
        <li>I always enjoyed listening to music and creating it since young</li>
        <li>It can be scaled infinitely</li>
